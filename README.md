# Pressure-Sensor
Intel Edison powered pressure sensor.
This project is based on Intel's Galileo board, and has been ported to Intel's Edison board.
Edison compares two different resistance readings, and turns on/off LED's based on the resistance value. 
LED's are used to quickly notify the user if the pressure sensor has any force applied to it.
